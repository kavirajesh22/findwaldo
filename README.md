# Where's my Waldo?
> ## Lost your dog? Don't know where to look for them? Our app plays the game of "Where's Waldo" for you, uniting neighbors together in bringing pets home one swipe at a time.

## Inspiration
According to "Bring Jackson Home", 10 million dogs are lost per year. 70% of dogs that go missing are actually within a one-mile radius of their homes. We wanted to create an app that brings neighbors together in helping their dogs find their homes again.

## What it does
Where's Your Waldo is an interactive and community uniting technology which help lost pet owners find their pet. Simply upload a photo and the last known location of your pet. Meanwhile, our community of 'Spotters' can post real-time sightings with photos and locations whenever they spot a lost pet.

Our smart system immediately gets to work, comparing these sightings against your pet’s details. As matches pop up, you swipe through them, right if it’s a maybe, left if it’s not a match. Your responses fine-tune the search process, thanks to our advanced machine learning, making each suggestion more accurate than the last.

## How we built it
Using Node.Js, React, Javascript, and Figma, I went through the prototyping, and then created a interactive React web-based framework. I deployed a Google Maps API into sending the current locations of the owners and neighbors that spot their dogs.

## Challenges we ran into
A big challenge was getting the Google Maps API to deploy properly into our React framework, but in the end, it all paid off.

##What's next for Where's my Waldo?
Towards the future, we hope to deploy a machine learning recognition model onto the matching between the spotters' pictures and the owners' dogs. We also hope to convert from a web to an app-based framework as I had planned to do in the beginning.
